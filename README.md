# FEDORA + VAGRANT + ANSIBLE

An experiment to test my development environment in a vagrant machine with ansible before installing. 

The main idea wold be to pull down a fedoracloud image and test the installation and configuration before installing in bare metal.

This is a work in progress.

## TODO

#TODO Integrate the previous work done in https://github.com/FelipeCabelloE/ansible-fedora-setup

#TODO provision Docker in the machine while the podman workflow is not ready

#TODO provision mambaforge
